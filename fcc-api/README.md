# FCC Python APIs

The Python libraries in this directory were auto-generated from the OpenAPI specs offered by the FCC at [publicfiles.fcc.gov/developer/](https://publicfiles.fcc.gov/developer/) using [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen)

## Code Generation

After installing `swagger-codegen`:

`$ swagger-codegen generate -i solr-search.json -l python -o .`
